## USER STORY
Social media has done a lot to bring people together by allowing people to share their stories, thoughts, ideas, etc. across the internet. It has also brought about a lot of negativity in the form of trolls, random people posting derogatory comments, and a host of other undesirable online behavior. Our application seeks to bring people even closer together by allowing them to create micro-social networks that they can limit membership to. This allows groups to filter out trolls, random users, etc. 

As a user, I envision using this application with my family or with my group of friends. This application can allow even the youngest member of my family to experience social media in a controlled environment while also allowing other members of the family to communicate, share, and enjoy each other's virtual company. With regard to using this application with friends, it allows small groups to really come together and foster more meaningful connections without having the distraction of seeing people or events outside of their immediate network.
